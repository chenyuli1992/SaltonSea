I’m using this function from spicy scipy.spatial.cKDTree: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.cKDTree.html
From what I understand it’s an unsupervised method to classify neighbors. This page on scikit learn has some explanations about it https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neighbors.html

You just have to be careful with the leaf-size parameter, because if you request more points than that it will change to the normal way of calculating distances and at least for me it gets a bit slower. But they also say its effective depends on the dataset.
